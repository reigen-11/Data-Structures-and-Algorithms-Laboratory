Second Year of Computer Engineering (2019 Course)  217532  :  Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory

## Assignments
1.  Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly
    look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare
    them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers

2.  Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using
    chaining with / without replacement.
    Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, Keys must
    be unique
    Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

3.  For given set of elements create skip list. Find the element in the set that is closest to some
    given value. (note: Decide the level of element in the list Randomly with some upper limit) 

4.  To create ADT that implement the "set" concept.
    
    
    a.Add (newElement) -Place a value into the set
    b.Remove (element) Remove the value
    c. Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection
    d.Size () Return number of values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop over
    collection
    e. Intersection of two sets
    f.Union of two sets
    g.Difference between two sets
    h.Subset
